  <p class="text" style="text-align: center;">
    Majority of businesses are faced with adapting to the evolution brought about by the prevalence of technology. This adaptation ranges from encouraging remote jobs to the need to digitally transform their operations. Integrating technology in business creates the process of automating and systematizing workflows and processes, keeps lines of communication open, enables more strategic planning and time management, among others. In essence, technology creates profitability and efficiency in businesses when employed right. As the first technology hub in Ogun State, Lead Resources supports corporate customers around the globe with IT-driven business solutions and helps our customers soar to greater heights riding on the shoulders of technology.

    <b>1. Technology for SDG Solutions/App Development</b> - Technology can be a powerful tool in helping to solve the worldâ€™s most challenging issues including SDGs. But businesses often struggle to come up with a systemic way to strategically apply technology to their missions.
    <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox1" />
    <label for="checkbox1" id="inline1"><a>Read more</a></label>
    <span id="s1">Digital transformation is not simply about technology. Rather, it is fundamentally about connecting people, process, and technology to enable innovation and drive a step change in impact while helping fulfill SDG goals. This is why LEAD Resources supports organizations  in ensuring their operations and missions align with certain SDG Goals with the aim of solving societal problems using technology.</span>

  <p class="text" style="text-align: left">
    <b>2. Turning Academic Research to Innovation (TARTI)</b> - It is general knowledge that in most tertiary institutions in Nigeria, after final-year students engage in project defense, their academic research papers are stacked and locked up in departmental resource centers for a few years after which they are disposed of.
    <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox2" />
    <label for="checkbox2" id="inline2"><a>Read more</a></label>
    <span id="s2">Hence, researches which should be adopted, funded and utilized for economic sustenance and national development are lost in the annals of history. The ripple effect of this course of action is the stagnation and retrogression of the nation and her citizens.
    In a bid to solve this problem, LEAD Resources created TARTI (Turning Academic Research to Innovation), an accelerator incubation programme designed to turn the solutions and recommendations embedded in the projects of young, talented Nigerians to innovative start-ups that can solve most of our pressing challenges. The programme involves the selection of innovative researches from students across various disciplines such as Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Agriculture, Statistics, etc. The innovators of these researches are made to undergo incubation until their ideas are developed and eventually scaled for maximum profit for themselves and the nation at large.</span>

  <p class="text" style="text-align: left">
    <b>3. Market Adoption and Sustainable Implementation of Sustainable Solutions (MASITS)</b>

    <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox4" />
    <label for="checkbox4" id="inline4"><a>Read more</a></label>
    <span id="s4">The DEAG in its analysis of the economic environment chose to pivot the development of the digital economic ecosystem of Ogun State on six Economic pillars namely: Digital Government, Digital Business, Digital Infrastructure, Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship, Human Capital and Socio-Cultural. The facilitation of industrial evolution of a State cannot be done at a sustainably incremental rate using analogue processes, operations, administration and financing models. Hence, the deliberate effort by DEAG to strategically drive the economic growth desired by the citizens of the State through a strategic plan hinged on digital pillars which is also in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (2020-2030) of NITDA.</span>
