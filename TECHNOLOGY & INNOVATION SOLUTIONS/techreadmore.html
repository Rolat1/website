    <p class="texts">Majority of businesses are faced with adapting to the evolution brought about by the
        prevalence of technology. This adaptation ranges from encouraging remote jobs to the need to digitally
        transform their operations. Integrating technology in business creates the process of automating and
        systematizing workflows and processes, keeps lines of communication open, enables more strategic planning
        and time management, among others. In essence, technology creates profitability and efficiency in businesses
        when employed right. As the first technology hub in Ogun State, Lead Resources supports corporate customers
        around the globe with IT-driven business solutions and helps our customers soar to greater heights riding on
        the shoulders of technology.
    </p>
    <p class="texts">Our services in this department is divided into the following areas:
    </p>
    </div>

    <p class="firsttext"><b>1. Technology for SDG Solutions/App Development - </b> Technology can be a powerful tool in
        helping to solve the
        worldâ€™s most challenging issues including SDGs. But businesses often struggle to come up with a systemic way to
        strategically apply technology to their missions. Digital transformation is not simply about technology. Rather,
        it is fundamentally about connecting people, process, and technology to enable innovation and drive a step
        change in impact while helping fulfill SDG goals. This is why LEAD Resources supports organizations in ensuring
        their operations and missions align with certain SDG Goals with the aim of solving societal problems using
        technology.

    </p>


    <p class="firsttext"><b>2. Turning Academic Research to Innovation (TARTI) - </b>It is general knowledge that in
        most tertiary institutions in Nigeria, after final-year students engage in project defense, their academic
        research papers are stacked and locked up in departmental resource centers for a few years after which they are
        disposed of. Hence, researches which should be adopted, funded and utilized for economic sustenance and national
        development are lost in the annals of history. The ripple effect of this course of action is the stagnation and
        retrogression of the nation and her citizens.
        In a bid to solve this problem, LEAD Resources created TARTI (Turning Academic Research to Innovation), an
        accelerator incubation programme designed to turn the solutions and recommendations embedded in the projects of
        young, talented Nigerians to innovative start-ups that can solve most of our pressing challenges. The programme
        involves the selection of innovative researches from students across various disciplines such as Computer
        Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Agriculture, Statistics, etc. The innovators of these
        researches are made to undergo incubation until their ideas are developed and eventually scaled for maximum
        profit for themselves and the nation at large. </p>


    <p class="firsttext"><b>3. Market Adoption and Sustainable Implementation of Sustainable Solutions (MASITS)</b></p>

    <p class="firsttext"><b>4. Incubation and Acceleration -</b>Our incubation and acceleration is an Entrepreneurship
        Training and Innovation support programme that involves an extended 6 months programme called Start-Up Loop
        which is designed to take Start-up Entrepreneurs through a tested and proven process that will help them
        articulate, build and convert their viable business idea into innovative and marketable products and services.
        The initiative will develop the capacities of the entrepreneurs by equipping them with the necessary tools,
        skills and techniques through effective experiential training, pitching events and supportive coaching. We also
        assist in linking them up with potential investors.
    </p>


    <p class="firsttext"><b>
            5. Founding Member, Ogun State Digital Economy Advisory Group (DEAG) -</b>The DEAG is a body of key
        stakeholders in the Information Technology ecosystem of Ogun State of which the Director of the Ogun State
        Bureau of Information Technology (BIT) is a member. The DEAG in its analysis of the economic environment chose
        to pivot the development of the digital economic ecosystem of Ogun State on six Economic pillars namely: Digital
        Government, Digital Business, Digital Infrastructure, Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship, Human Capital and
        Socio-Cultural. The facilitation of industrial evolution of a State cannot be done at a sustainably incremental
        rate using analogue processes, operations, administration and financing models. Hence, the deliberate effort by
        DEAG to strategically drive the economic growth desired by the citizens of the State through a strategic plan
        hinged on digital pillars which is also in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy
        (2020-2030) of NITDA.

    </p>


    <p class="firsttext"><b>6. HAMORAH - </b> It is the pilot project of the Ogun State Digital Ecosystem Advisory Group
        (DEAG) - a 100% private sector-led think-tank with the mandate of facilitating the digital development of the
        economy of Ogun State. Hamorah is a technology platform focused on creating, identifying, and promoting the
        socio-cultural heritage, and activities of Ogun State. It is to create and establish a competitive framework for
        the Indigenes of the State also to provide indigenous contents in areas of people, artifacts, places, festivals,
        events, commerce, history and a lot more. The platform provides access to knowledge about different traditions
        and cultures but also the opportunity to contribute to the platform by posting their own content and engaging
        with that of others.
    </p>


    <p class="firsttext"><b>7. SDG Solutions Convergence -</b>an initiative that creates a process and environment for
        brilliant minds to transform ideas into innovations and inventions. This is targeted towards individuals,
        entrepreneurs and organizations to stimulate commitment and action towards creating a technology driven Solution
        in-line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Convergence consists of a holistic awareness on how
        to identify the problems by looking at the Sustainable Development Goals, determining and creating solutions
        leveraging on the use of Emerging Technology and Design Thinking, and then finally turning these
        solutions/innovations into business opportunities using Business Model Canvas/LEAN Canvas. Also, we belong to a
        State consortium saddled with the responsibility of SDG mainstreaming into enterprise and business processes, as
        well as advocacy for solutions thinking and engagements.</p>
